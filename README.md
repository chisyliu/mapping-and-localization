## Test  codes
- [1D Bayersian Filter](./1D-BayesianFilter)
- [Toy Particle Filter](./ToyParticleFilter)

## 2D Particle Filter
In this project, a two dimensional particle filter in C++ was implemented. The particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step the filter will also get observation and control data.

Details can be found [here](./2D-ParticleFilter)
